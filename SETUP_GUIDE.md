## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Setup**

### **1. Enhanced User Management Setup**

**Problem Solved**: Admin dashboard was not showing all users and their email addresses.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive user management with real email access.

Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create safe user email access function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_users_with_emails()
RETURNS TABLE (
    id UUID,
    email CHARACTER VARYING(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    last_sign_in TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
) 
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    IF auth.role() != 'authenticated' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Access denied. Only authenticated users can call this function.';
    END IF;
    
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT 
        au.id,
        au.email,
        au.created_at,
        au.last_sign_in_at
    FROM auth.users au
    WHERE au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY au.created_at DESC;
END;
$$;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_users_with_emails() TO authenticated;

-- Step 2: Create enhanced user management views
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW users_overview AS
WITH user_activities AS (
    SELECT user_id, NULL as user_email, created_at, 'role' as activity_type
    FROM user_roles
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user_id, user_email, created_at, 'discussion' as activity_type
    FROM discussions WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user_id, NULL as user_email, created_at, 'like' as activity_type
    FROM likes WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
),
auth_user_emails AS (
    SELECT id, email, created_at FROM get_users_with_emails()
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    ua.user_id as id,
    COALESCE(ua.user_email, aue.email, 'User ' || LEFT(ua.user_id::text, 8) || '...') as email,
    COALESCE(aue.created_at, MIN(ua.created_at)) as first_activity,
    MAX(ua.created_at) as last_activity,
    ur.role,
    CASE WHEN ur.role = 'admin' THEN true ELSE false END as is_admin,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ua.activity_type) as activity_count,
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT ua.activity_type) FILTER (WHERE ua.activity_type IS NOT NULL) as activities
FROM user_activities ua
LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON ua.user_id = ur.user_id
LEFT JOIN auth_user_emails aue ON ua.user_id = aue.id
GROUP BY ua.user_id, ua.user_email, ur.role, aue.email, aue.created_at
ORDER BY last_activity DESC;

GRANT SELECT ON users_overview TO authenticated;

-- Step 3: Create comprehensive admin user view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW admin_users_comprehensive AS
SELECT 
    au.id,
    au.email,
    au.created_at as auth_created_at,
    au.last_sign_in_at,
    ur.role,
    ur.created_at as role_created_at,
    CASE WHEN ur.role = 'admin' THEN true ELSE false END as is_admin,
    CASE WHEN ur.role IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has Role' ELSE 'No Role' END as role_status,
    COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM discussions disc WHERE disc.user_id = au.id), 0) as discussion_count,
    COALESCE((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes l WHERE l.user_id = au.id), 0) as like_count,
    0 as document_count,
    CASE WHEN au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'Confirmed' ELSE 'Unconfirmed' END as email_status
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON au.id = ur.user_id
WHERE au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY au.created_at DESC;

GRANT SELECT ON admin_users_comprehensive TO authenticated;

-- Step 4: Implement automatic user role assignment
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, created_at)
    VALUES (NEW.id, 'member', NOW())
    ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
    AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();

-- Step 5: Backfill existing users without roles
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, created_at)
SELECT au.id, 'member', au.created_at
FROM auth.users au
WHERE au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur WHERE ur.user_id = au.id)
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

**Benefits of User Management Setup:**
- ‚úÖ **100% user visibility** in admin dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Real email addresses** for all users
- ‚úÖ **Automatic role assignment** for new signups
- ‚úÖ **Activity tracking** and engagement metrics
- ‚úÖ **Complete user management** capabilities

### **2. Document Tagging System Setup (Optional Enhancement)**

**Note**: This is an optional enhancement for better document organization.

```sql
-- Create tags table for document categorization
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tags (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  color TEXT DEFAULT '#6B7280',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Create document_tags junction table for many-to-many relationship
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS document_tags (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(document_id, tag_id)
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_document_tags_document_id ON document_tags(document_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_document_tags_tag_id ON document_tags(tag_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tags_name ON tags(name);

-- Enable RLS for new tables
ALTER TABLE tags ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE document_tags ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for tags table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all tags" ON tags
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Only admins can create tags" ON tags
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Only admins can update tags" ON tags
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Only admins can delete tags" ON tags
  FOR DELETE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- RLS Policies for document_tags table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all document tags" ON document_tags
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Only admins can manage document tags" ON document_tags
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON tags TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON document_tags TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE tags_id_seq TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE document_tags_id_seq TO authenticated;

-- Insert some default tags for common document categories
INSERT INTO tags (name, color) VALUES 
  ('Technical Specification', '#3B7280'),    -- Blue
  ('Meeting Minutes', '#10B981'),           -- Green
  ('Policy Document', '#F59E0B'),           -- Yellow
  ('Procedure Guide', '#8B5CF6'),           -- Purple
  ('Research Paper', '#EF4444'),            -- Red
  ('Standard Operating Procedure', '#06B6D4'), -- Cyan
  ('Training Material', '#84CC16'),         -- Lime
  ('Reference Document', '#F97316')         -- Orange
ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;
```

```

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **User Management Verification**

1. **Check user management functions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_name = 'get_users_with_emails';
   ```

2. **Check user management views:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views 
   WHERE table_name IN ('users_overview', 'admin_users_comprehensive');
   ```

3. **Test user coverage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM admin_users_comprehensive;
   SELECT COUNT(*) as users_with_emails FROM get_users_with_emails();
   ```

### **Document Tagging Verification (Optional)**

1. **Check tables exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('tags', 'document_tags');
   ```

2. **Check default tags:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM tags ORDER BY name;
   ```

3. **Check RLS policies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename IN ('tags', 'document_tags');
   ```

### **Forum Verification**

Run this query to verify your forum setup:

```sql
SELECT 
  table_name, 
  table_type 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('discussions', 'discussion_replies', 'user_roles', 'likes');
```

You should see all four tables listed.

### **Admin Role Verification**

Check if a user has admin privileges:

```sql
SELECT u.email, ur.role 
FROM auth.users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
WHERE ur.role = 'admin';
```

### **Like System Verification** ‚úÖ NEW

Test the like system functionality:

```sql
-- Check if likes table has data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes;

-- Check like distribution
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN discussion_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Discussion'
    WHEN reply_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Reply'
  END as like_type,
  COUNT(*) as like_count
FROM likes 
GROUP BY like_type;

-- Check user like activity
SELECT 
  u.email,
  COUNT(l.id) as total_likes
FROM auth.users u
JOIN likes l ON u.id = l.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.email
ORDER BY total_likes DESC;
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Table doesn't exist" errors**
   - Make sure you've run the database schema
