- Validation: Adding schemas, not changing logic
- npm audit: Security improvements only

**Mitigation:** Gradual rollout, thorough testing

### **Phase 2 (Weeks 20-24): LOW-MEDIUM RISK** 🟡
- Contexts: New patterns alongside existing (co-exist)
- Toasts: UI improvement, no functional change
- Dependencies: Incremental updates
- Performance: Measurements first, optimize second

**Mitigation:** Feature flags where possible, gradual rollout

### **Phase 3 (Deferred): MEDIUM-HIGH RISK** 🟡🟠
- Component splitting: Touches many files
- Refactoring: Complex logic changes
- CSS: Could affect visual appearance

**Mitigation:** Maintenance window, extensive testing, rollback plan
