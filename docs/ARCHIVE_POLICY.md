# Archive Policy

This policy keeps historical documents discoverable without polluting active documentation.

## Scope
- Applies to markdown documents under `docs/` that are superseded or replaced.
- Generated artifacts (test reports, coverage, build output) are **not** archived and should be ignored.

## Archive Location
- All archives live under: `docs/archive/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>/`
- One topic per folder; do not mix unrelated docs.

## Naming and Immutability
- Keep original filenames; do not edit archived files.
- If a correction is needed, create a new dated archive folder.

## Required Archive README
Each archive folder must include a short `README.md` with:
- Purpose and scope of the archive
- Creation date
- Source/preceding document(s)
- Originating commit hash (if known)
- Notes on replacements or successors

## Required Index/Manifest Updates
When adding an archive:
- Add an entry in `docs/INDEX.md` under an Archive section.
- Register the archive files in `docs/_meta/docs-manifest.json` with lifecycle `HISTORICAL`.

## Archive Gate
- Run `npm run docs:archive:investigate` before moving or deleting docs.
- Do not archive when the investigation gate fails.

## Prohibited Content
- Do not archive autogenerated output such as `playwright-report/`, `coverage/`, or build artifacts.
- Use `.gitignore` for generated files instead.
