## üö® **CRITICAL DEBUGGING SCENARIOS & SOLUTIONS**

### **Scenario 1: Question Text Synchronization Issues**
**Date**: January 26, 2025  
**Problem**: Holistic protection questions showed different text in CEW polls vs admin panel vs database  
**Symptoms**: 
- CEW polls displayed correct question text
- Admin panel showed "Question not found" errors
- Database contained placeholder text ("Question 3 text")

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Frontend components had hardcoded question text
- Database contained outdated placeholder text
- Admin panel `currentPollQuestions` array didn't match database
- No synchronization between different data sources

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "Frontend components fetch question text from database" - WRONG, they were hardcoded
2. ‚ùå "Database is the single source of truth" - WRONG, frontend was hardcoded
3. ‚ùå "Admin panel automatically matches questions" - WRONG, requires exact text matching

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Updated database question text to match CEW_Poll_Questions.txt
2. Updated CEW polls frontend components with identical text
3. Updated survey-results frontend components with identical text
4. Updated admin panel `currentPollQuestions` array
5. Updated k6 test scripts with new question text
6. Verified all locations display identical text

**Prevention Measures**:
- Always verify data flow from database ‚Üí API ‚Üí frontend components
- Implement question matching validation in admin panel
- Document all data sources and their synchronization requirements
- Test all locations after any question text changes

### **Scenario 2: Admin Panel Question Matching Failures**
**Date**: January 26, 2025  
**Problem**: Admin panel could not match submitted responses to questions  
**Symptoms**:
- Responses submitted successfully to database
- Admin panel displayed "Question not found" for all responses
- Console showed "Single-choice poll not matching current questions"

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- `currentPollQuestions` array in admin panel didn't match database question text
- Case-sensitive text matching required exact matches
- Extra spaces or special characters caused matching failures

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "Admin panel automatically matches questions" - WRONG, requires exact text matching
2. ‚ùå "Text matching is case-insensitive" - WRONG, case-sensitive matching required
3. ‚ùå "Minor text differences don't matter" - WRONG, exact matches required

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Updated `currentPollQuestions` array to match database exactly
2. Implemented exact text matching (case-sensitive)
3. Added validation for text matching in admin panel
4. Tested with known question text to verify matching

**Prevention Measures**:
- Implement question matching validation in admin panel
- Use exact text matching with case sensitivity
- Add logging for failed matches to aid debugging
- Test question matching with known data sets

**Symptoms**:
- Matrix graphs displayed 3 data points instead of expected 4
- Filter system didn't work properly
- Data points didn't match expected counts

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- API was not properly combining data from both `/survey-results` and `/cew-polls` paths
- Missing `combineResults` helper function
- Data aggregation logic was incomplete

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "Matrix graphs automatically aggregate all data" - WRONG, requires explicit data combination
2. ‚ùå "API handles data combination automatically" - WRONG, requires explicit implementation
3. ‚ùå "Data from different paths is automatically merged" - WRONG, requires explicit merging

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Implemented `combineResults` helper function to merge data from both paths
2. Updated API to properly combine data from survey-results and cew-polls
3. Added comprehensive logging for data flow debugging
4. Tested with known data sets to verify aggregation

**Prevention Measures**:

- All filters showed same response counts
- No filtering logic implemented in API

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Filter parameter wasn't being passed from frontend to API
- API didn't receive filter parameter
- No filtering logic implemented in API endpoint

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "Filter system works automatically" - WRONG, requires explicit implementation
2. ‚ùå "API automatically receives filter parameters" - WRONG, requires explicit passing
3. ‚ùå "Filtering logic is built-in" - WRONG, requires explicit implementation

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Updated frontend to pass `filterMode` to API
2. Modified API to receive and process filter parameter
3. Implemented filtering logic in API endpoint

**Symptoms**:
- Poll results displayed generic option labels
- No actual option text displayed
- Database contained placeholder values

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Database `options` JSONB column contained placeholder values
- Frontend expected actual option text
- No validation for option text content

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "Option text is automatically generated" - WRONG, it's stored in database
2. ‚ùå "Database contains correct option text" - WRONG, contained placeholders
3. ‚ùå "Frontend handles option text automatically" - WRONG, requires database content

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Updated `options` JSONB column with correct option strings
2. Verified option text matches frontend expectations
3. Added validation for option text content

- Question 1 missing from admin panel
- Confusion between database and UI indexing

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Zero-based indexing in database vs one-based indexing in UI
- Mapping logic didn't account for indexing difference
- No documentation of indexing conventions

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "poll_index matches question number" - WRONG, poll_index is zero-based
2. ‚ùå "Database and UI use same indexing" - WRONG, different indexing systems
3. ‚ùå "Indexing is consistent across systems" - WRONG, different conventions

**Solution Implemented**:

- Question numbers didn't match expected sequence
- Duplicate data existed in database

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Old duplicate questions (poll_index 10-12) still existed in database
- Cleanup process was incomplete
- No verification of cleanup completion

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "Database cleanup was complete" - WRONG, duplicates remained
2. ‚ùå "Cleanup process was thorough" - WRONG, incomplete cleanup
3. ‚ùå "No duplicate data exists" - WRONG, duplicates remained

**Solution Implemented**:

**Symptoms**:
- Error: `Cannot find module 'D:\SSTAC-Dashboard\node_modules\k6\http'`
- k6 tests didn't run
- Wrong command used for execution

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- k6 scripts must be run with `k6 run` command, not `node`
- k6 is a separate tool, not a Node.js module
- No documentation of proper execution commands

**Bad Assumptions Made**:
1. ‚ùå "k6 scripts run like regular Node.js scripts" - WRONG, they're k6-specific
2. ‚ùå "node command works for all scripts" - WRONG, k6 requires specific command
