## 💡 Tips for Using Templates

1. **Copy the entire template** that matches your needs
2. **Fill in specific details** in the "I want to focus on:" sections
3. **Add any context** about your current task or challenge
4. **Specify constraints** (e.g., "must be production-safe", "limited to frontend changes")
5. **Ask specific questions** after the AI reviews the documents
