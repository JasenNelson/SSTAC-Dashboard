Tiered Framework Polling Questions

Poll Question 1: 
What is the primary regulatory advantage of using a probabilistic framework (e.g., Bayesian) to integrate EqP and BLM predictions into a scientific framework for deriving site-specific sediment standards (Tier 2)? 
A) It provides a formal structure for quantifying and communicating uncertainty in the final standard.  
B) It allows for the systematic integration of existing literature data as priors, reducing site-specific data needs. 
C) It produces a full risk distribution rather than a single point value, allowing for more flexible management decisions. 
D) It improves the technical defensibility by making all assumptions (priors, model structure) explicit
E) Other

Poll Question 2: 
In developing a probabilistic framework for deriving site-specific sediment standards (Tier 2), which data type is most critical for effectively narrowing the uncertainty of the final risk estimate?
A) A large number of sediment chemistry samples to better characterize spatial heterogeneity.
B) High-quality, in-situ passive sampling data to directly measure and constrain bioavailable concentrations.
C) Site-specific toxicity testing data to develop more relevant priors for the dose-response relationship.
D) Detailed measurements of secondary geochemical parameters (e.g., black carbon, iron oxides) that influence partitioning.
E) Other

Poll Question 3: 
What is the biggest practical hurdle to overcome when implementing a Bayesian framework in the development of a scientific framework for deriving site-specific sediment standards (Tier 2)?
A) Defining appropriate priors, especially when site-specific information is sparse and literature values vary widely
B) The high level of statistical expertise required by both the practitioner and the regulatory reviewer to ensure proper application.
C) The challenge of communicating probabilistic outputs (e.g., posterior distributions) to non-technical stakeholders and decision-makers.
D) The lack of standardized software and guidance, leading to potential inconsistencies across different site assessments.
E) Other

Ranking Question 3:
To help focus development of matrix standards, please rank the four actions below for the degree to which they would improve utility of the standards (1 = top priority; 4 = lowest priority). If you do not know or have an opinion, do not respond to any given question.
Distinguish "direct toxicity" and "food pathway toxicity" pathways explicitly.
Clarify approach for incorporating human health endpoints in matrix standards.
Clarify how spatial scale (areal spatial extent, vertical depth profile) is incorporated in application of matrix standards.
Clarify whether and how multiple levels of protection are applied to account for differences in ecological sensitivity.

Ranking Question 4:
Of the four options below, what focus will provide greatest value to holistic sediment management in BC? (1 = top priority; 4 = lowest priority)
Push guidance beyond generic numerical standards: Apply models and other technical tools to help develop Site-Specific Sediment Standards (Tier 2) for ecological health (e.g., equilibrium partitioning [EqP], acid volatile sulphides/simultaneously extractable metals [AVS/SEM], other modifying factors)
Fill gaps and use surrogates: Develop Sediment Standards for missing substances and groups, using contaminants with an analogue (e.g., quantitative structure-activity relationship [QSAR]).
Increase guidance for effects-based tools: Develop guidance for site-specific toxicity testing and/or biological monitoring, to evaluate site-specific risks beyond screening level assessment.
Incorporate models and/or approaches for common mixtures: Develop sediment standards based on mixture models (e.g., target lipid model for petroleum hydrocarbons, toxic equivalents) rather than individual substances.

Wordcloud Question 5:
Overall, what is the greatest constraint to advancing holistic sediment protection in BC?
Data availability (quantity, quality)
Tools (models, test protocols, decision trees)
Agreement on application (e.g., protection goals, spatial scale, matrix approach)
Prescription (balance between consistency and flexibility [tiering] across different sites)
Resourcing (e.g., effort of developing approach/tools, consultation, documentation)
