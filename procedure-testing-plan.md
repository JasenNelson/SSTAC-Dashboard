# ðŸ§ª Poll Update Procedure Testing Plan

## Phase 3: Test Our New Poll Update Procedure

### **Test Scenario: Minor Option Text Update**
We'll test our procedure by making a small, safe change to verify the process works correctly.

#### **Proposed Test Change**
- **Target**: Holistic Protection Question 1 (single-choice poll)
- **Current Option 0**: "Strongly Disagree"
- **Test Change**: "Strongly Disagree" â†’ "Strongly Disagree (Test)"
- **Rationale**: Small text change that won't affect functionality but will verify the process

### **Step-by-Step Testing Process**

#### **Step 1: Pre-Change Verification**
- [ ] Run comprehensive database review scripts
- [ ] Document current state of Holistic Protection Question 1
- [ ] Verify all pages show identical content
- [ ] Confirm vote counts are accurate
- [ ] Take screenshots of current state

#### **Step 2: Apply Test Change**
- [ ] Update survey-results page: `HolisticProtectionClient.tsx`
- [ ] Update cew-polls page: `page.tsx`
- [ ] Update admin panel: `PollResultsClient.tsx` (currentPollQuestions array)
- [ ] Verify all three locations have identical changes

#### **Step 3: Database Update**
- [ ] Run the updated poll creation logic
- [ ] Verify new poll is created with updated options
- [ ] Confirm old poll data is preserved (votes remain intact)
- [ ] Test that all pages now show the updated option text

#### **Step 4: Functionality Verification**
- [ ] Test voting on survey-results page
- [ ] Test voting on cew-polls page
- [ ] Verify votes are properly stored
- [ ] Check admin panel displays updated option text
- [ ] Confirm filtering still works correctly
- [ ] Test all navigation features

#### **Step 5: Rollback Test**
- [ ] Revert all changes back to original state
- [ ] Verify system returns to pre-test state
- [ ] Confirm no data was lost during the process
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] All three pages show identical updated content
- [ ] Database contains updated poll with preserved vote data
- [ ] Voting functionality works on all pages
- [ ] Admin panel displays updated content correctly
- [ ] All filtering and navigation features work
- [ ] Rollback restores original state completely
- [ ] No errors or bugs introduced

### **Documentation Updates**
- [ ] Update procedure documentation based on test results
- [ ] Note any issues or improvements needed
- [ ] Refine the process for future use

## Alternative Test Scenarios (if needed)

### **Scenario A: Add New Option**
- Add a new option to an existing poll
- Test that existing votes are preserved
- Verify new option appears in all locations

### **Scenario B: Reorder Options**
- Change the order of options in a poll
- Test that vote mapping still works correctly
- Verify charts display properly with reordered options

### **Scenario C: Ranking Poll Update**
- Update options in a ranking poll
- Test that existing ranking votes are preserved
- Verify ranking calculations still work correctly

## Risk Mitigation

### **Before Testing**
- [ ] Create full database backup
- [ ] Document current poll IDs and vote counts
- [ ] Test in development environment first (if available)

### **During Testing**
- [ ] Make changes incrementally
- [ ] Test each change immediately
- [ ] Keep rollback plan ready

### **After Testing**
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Clean up any test data
- [ ] Document lessons learned
