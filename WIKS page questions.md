Poll 1: A Braided Baseline Study  
What is the most effective starting point for developing a holistic baseline study that combines co-located sampling (e.g., sediment, porewater, tissue, surface water) with area-based Indigenous Knowledge and Science?  
1\. A co-developed conceptual site model that uses Indigenous Knowledge to first identify key species, exposure pathways, and areas of cultural significance to guide the scientific sampling plan.  
2\. A comprehensive literature and data review that compiles all existing scientific and Indigenous knowledge for the area to identify critical data gaps that the baseline study must fill.  
3\. A pilot-scale field study conducted collaboratively with community members to test and validate sampling methods and ensure they are effective and culturally appropriate.  
4\. A series of collaborative workshops where knowledge holders and scientists share information to establish a shared understanding of the ecosystem's history, health, and stressors.

Poll 2: Enhancing Scientific Protection Goals  
How can the scientific framework incorporate protection goals related to Indigenous Stewardship principles such as the 'connectedness of all life' and '7-generations'?   
1\. By using food-web models that scientifically map contaminant pathways between species.  
2\. By developing Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) that include culturally significant local species.  
3\. By setting protective tissue residue guidelines for key indicator species to ensure long-term safety.  
4\. By incorporating ecosystem function metrics (e.g., nutrient cycling) as formal scientific endpoints.  
5\. By developing standards to protect the fitness of resources for various traditional uses, such as medicinal plants.

Poll 3: A Braided Tiered Approach in Practice  
Within a tiered framework, where can place-based Indigenous Knowledge provide the most direct scientific value for modifying a generic baseline value to be more site-specific?  
1\. Informing bioavailability models with specific knowledge of local sediment characteristics and processes.  
2\. Identifying sensitive local species or life stages not included in the generic models for a more accurate risk calculation.  
3\. Characterizing unique, site-specific contaminant exposure pathways that would alter baseline risk model assumptions.  
4\. Identifying potential confounding environmental factors (e.g., freshwater seeps) influencing scientific measurements.
