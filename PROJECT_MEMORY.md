## 🚨 CRITICAL: Recurring Security & Indexing Issues (2025-01-20)

### Supabase Security Invoker Warning - RECURRING ISSUE
**PROBLEM**: Supabase repeatedly detects and warns about missing `security_invoker = on` in view definitions
**FREQUENCY**: This issue occurs MULTIPLE TIMES as Supabase automatically identifies security improvements
**IMPACT**: Potential security vulnerabilities in production environment
**ROOT CAUSE**: Views created without explicit security settings default to creator permissions

**SOLUTION APPLIED**:
- Updated both `poll_results` and `ranking_results` views with `WITH (security_invoker = on)`
- Applied security invoker to ALL views for consistency
- Documented requirement in database schema files

**PREVENTION PROTOCOL**:
- ✅ **ALWAYS include** `WITH (security_invoker = on)` when creating/updating views
- ✅ **Document this requirement** in all database schema files
- ✅ **Apply to ALL views** for comprehensive security coverage

### Ranking Results View Array Indexing Bug - RECURRING ISSUE
**PROBLEM**: The `+1` offset keeps getting reintroduced in `ranking_results` view definition
**FREQUENCY**: This bug has occurred MULTIPLE TIMES during system updates and AI-assisted changes
**IMPACT**: Blank option text in admin panel for ranking polls, breaking user interface
**ROOT CAUSE**: Misunderstanding of 0-based vs 1-based array indexing in PostgreSQL

**CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**:
```sql
-- WRONG (causes blank options):
'option_text', rp.options[option_stats.option_index + 1]

-- CORRECT (working version):
'option_text', rp.options[option_stats.option_index]
```

**SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ **Added to AGENTS.md**: Critical safeguard warning about array indexing
- ✅ **Documented in POLL_SYSTEM_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md**: Complete troubleshooting guide
- ✅ **Updated database_schema.sql**: Corrected view definition with security invoker
- ✅ **Created apply-security-improvements.sql**: Ready-to-run fix script

**KEY LEARNINGS**:
- The system uses 0-based indexing throughout (option_index: 0,1,2,3)
- The options JSONB array is also 0-based
- Adding +1 breaks the mapping and causes blank option text
- This is NOT a bug to "fix" - it's the correct implementation

## ✅ Admin Panel UI/UX Final Optimization Success (2025-01-21)

### Container Positioning and Text Wrapping Improvements - COMPLETED
**ACHIEVEMENT**: Successfully resolved complex UI/UX issues with container overlap and text wrapping
**DURATION**: Multiple iterations to achieve perfect balance
**CHALLENGE**: Finding the right combination of spacing, scaling, and positioning without overcomplicating the UI

- ✅ **Container Spacing**: Optimized `space-x-26` in expanded view for perfect container separation
- ✅ **Scaling Balance**: Both Join at and QR code containers at `scale-[1.45]` for proportional sizing
- ✅ **Text Wrapping**: Question text uses `max-w-4xl` in expanded view for optimal wrapping
- ✅ **Container Positioning**: Conservative `-ml-8 mt-2` for outer container positioning
- ✅ **Navigation Arrows**: Fixed alignment and sizing issues with proper button dimensions

**CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED**:
- **Simple solutions work best**: User's `space-x-14` fix was the key insight
- **Avoid overcomplicating**: Multiple positioning attempts made the UI worse
- **User feedback is essential**: Direct user input led to the correct solution
- **Incremental changes**: Small adjustments work better than large modifications

**FINAL RESULT**: 
- Perfect container spacing with no overlap
- Optimal question text wrapping in both normal and expanded views
- Properly sized and positioned navigation elements
- Clean, professional UI that works consistently across all views

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**:
```css
/* Container spacing - the key fix */
${isExpanded ? 'space-x-26' : 'space-x-3'}

/* Consistent scaling */
${isExpanded ? 'transform scale-[1.45]' : ''}

/* Optimal text width */
${isExpanded ? 'max-w-4xl' : 'max-w-3xl'}
```

## 🚨 Critical Debugging Incidents

### 1. Poll System Database & UI Synchronization Issues (2025-01-18)
**LESSON LEARNED**: Poll questions and options must be synchronized across database, survey-results pages, cew-polls pages, and admin panel. Any mismatch causes system-wide failures.

#### What Happened
- User updated poll questions in UI pages but database contained old questions
- Admin panel filtered out polls due to question text mismatch
- CEW responses showed 0 because database questions didn't match current page questions
- Ranking polls showed blank option text due to incorrect array indexing
- Filtering logic incorrectly scaled combined results instead of using original data

#### Root Causes Identified
1. **Three-Way Sync Failure**: Database, survey-results, and cew-polls pages had different questions
2. **Admin Panel Filtering**: Strict question matching filtered out mismatched polls
3. **Array Indexing Error**: `ranking_results` view used `+1` offset causing blank option text
4. **Filter Logic Issues**: CEW-only filter scaled combined data instead of using original CEW data
5. **Vote Count Confusion**: Ranking polls showed individual vote counts instead of participant counts

#### Key Problems Encountered
- **"CEW: 0 responses"** - Database questions didn't match admin panel expectations
- **Blank option text** - Array indexing off by one in ranking results view
- **"CEW Only" showing TWG data** - Filter logic used scaled combined results
- **"8 votes" for ranking poll** - Should show "2 responses" (participant count)
- **Question text mismatch** - Even minor differences caused filtering failures

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Database Cleanup**: Removed old polls, created new polls matching current UI
2. **Fixed Array Indexing**: Corrected `ranking_results` view to use 0-based indexing
3. **Fixed Filter Logic**: Store original survey/CEW data separately for accurate filtering
4. **Updated Vote Display**: Show "responses" for ranking polls, "votes" for single-choice
5. **Added Safeguards**: Updated documentation with critical warnings about array indexing

#### Technical Implementation Details
```sql
-- CRITICAL: ranking_results view uses 0-based indexing
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ranking_results AS
SELECT rp.id AS ranking_poll_id,
    -- ... other fields ...
    COALESCE(( SELECT jsonb_agg(jsonb_build_object(
        'option_index', option_stats.option_index, 
        'option_text', rp.options[option_stats.option_index], -- NO +1!
        'averageRank', option_stats.avg_rank, 
        'votes', option_stats.vote_count
    ) ORDER BY option_stats.option_index) AS jsonb_agg
    -- ... rest of view ...
```

```typescript
// Fixed filtering logic - store original data separately
const combinedPoll = {
  ...basePoll,
  survey_results: surveyResults,  // Store original survey data
  cew_results: cewResults        // Store original CEW data
};

// Use original data for filtering
const getFilteredPollResults = (poll: PollResult) => {
  if (poll.is_ranking) {
    if (filterMode === 'twg' && poll.survey_results) {
      return poll.survey_results;
    } else if (filterMode === 'cew' && poll.cew_results) {
      return poll.cew_results;
    }
  }
  return poll.results;
};
```

#### Key Takeaways
- **Database-First Updates**: Always update database before UI pages
- **Three-Way Sync**: Database, survey-results, and cew-polls must match exactly
- **Array Indexing**: System uses 0-based indexing throughout - never add +1
- **Vote vs Response**: Different poll types have different counting logic
- **Filter Data Storage**: Store original data separately for accurate filtering
- **Question Matching**: Admin panel uses strict substring matching

#### Future Prevention Protocol
1. **Backup First**: Always backup existing polls before updates
2. **Update Database**: Change database questions/options first
3. **Update Admin Panel**: Update `currentPollQuestions` array to match
4. **Update UI Pages**: Update survey-results and cew-polls pages
5. **Test All Systems**: Verify all three systems work together
6. **Document Changes**: Update documentation with any modifications

### 2. Admin Poll Results System - Complex Data Integration Issues (2025-09-17)
**LESSON LEARNED**: Complex data integration between survey and CEW polls requires careful debugging and systematic approach. Database interactions and vote counting logic are critical for accurate results display.

#### What Happened
- Admin poll results page showing incorrect vote counts and missing data
- WIKS polls not displaying TWG/SSTAC responses due to path mismatch
- Prioritization polls showing wrong total responses (8 instead of 2)
- TypeScript build errors preventing production deployment
- Complex data combination logic causing vote counting errors

#### Root Causes Identified
1. **Path Mismatch**: WIKS polls in `/wiks` not recognized as survey polls
2. **Vote Counting Logic**: Incorrect calculation of ranking vs single-choice poll votes
3. **Data Grouping**: Polls not properly grouped by topic and poll_index
4. **Type Safety**: Missing TypeScript type annotations causing build failures
5. **Filter Logic**: Complex filtering system not working correctly for combined data

#### Key Problems Encountered
- **"Total Responses: 8" when individual polls showed 1 vote each** - Math didn't add up
- **WIKS polls showing 0 TWG/SSTAC responses** - Path not recognized as survey data
- **Prioritization polls showing wrong question text** - Data combination issues
- **TypeScript build failures** - Implicit `any` types in reduce functions
- **Complex data structure** - Survey and CEW data not properly combined

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Fixed Path Recognition**: Added `/wiks` path to survey poll identification logic
2. **Corrected Vote Counting**: 
   - Ranking polls: Use `total_votes` (unique participants)
   - Single-choice polls: Sum votes from results array
3. **Improved Data Grouping**: Consistent keys for all topics (`topic_name_${poll_index}`)
4. **Fixed TypeScript Issues**: Added explicit type annotations for all functions
5. **Simplified Filter Logic**: Store original survey/CEW data separately for accurate filtering

#### Technical Implementation Details
```typescript
// Fixed vote counting logic
if (group.isRanking) {
  // For ranking polls, use total_votes field (unique participants)
  surveyVotes = surveyPoll ? (surveyPoll.total_votes || 0) : 0;
  cewVotes = cewPoll ? (cewPoll.total_votes || 0) : 0;
} else {
  // For single-choice polls, sum up all votes in the results
  surveyVotes = surveyPoll ? (surveyPoll.results || []).reduce((sum: number, result: any) => sum + (result.votes || 0), 0) : 0;
  cewVotes = cewPoll ? (cewPoll.results || []).reduce((sum: number, result: any) => sum + (result.votes || 0), 0) : 0;
}

// Fixed path recognition
if (poll.page_path.startsWith('/survey-results') || poll.page_path === '/wiks') {
  group.surveyPoll = poll;
}
```

#### Key Takeaways
- **Always verify data sources** - Check what data is actually being fetched from database
- **Understand poll types** - Ranking vs single-choice polls have different vote counting logic
- **Test data combination** - Complex data merging requires extensive testing
- **Type safety matters** - TypeScript errors prevent production builds
- **Path consistency** - All poll paths should follow consistent patterns
- **Debug systematically** - Add logging to trace data flow through complex systems

#### Future Prevention
- **Add comprehensive logging** for data combination processes
- **Test vote counting logic** with known data sets
- **Verify path patterns** before implementing new poll types
- **Use TypeScript strictly** - No implicit `any` types
- **Document data flow** - Map out how data moves through the system
- **Test edge cases** - Empty data, missing fields, type mismatches

### 2. Overly Complicated Color Scheme System (2025-01-XX)
**LESSON LEARNED**: The current color scheme system is overly complicated and creates maintenance nightmares. Simple, consistent color schemes are essential for maintainable code.

#### What Happened
- Multiple survey result pages have complex gradient backgrounds with inconsistent theming
- CSS specificity overrides are scattered throughout `globals.css` with 200+ rules
- Dark backgrounds appear in light mode due to conflicting CSS rules
- Each page requires individual CSS overrides to work properly
- Simple changes like background colors require extensive debugging

#### Root Cause
- **Over-Engineering**: Complex gradient systems that don't follow basic design principles
- **CSS Specificity Wars**: 200+ CSS rules with `!important` declarations fighting each other
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Each page has different color schemes instead of unified design system
- **No Design System**: Lack of standardized color tokens and consistent theming approach

#### Key Problems
- **Dark backgrounds in light mode**: Basic design principle violated repeatedly
- **CSS Override Hell**: `html.light` and `html.dark` rules scattered throughout codebase
- **Maintenance Nightmare**: Simple color changes require extensive CSS debugging
- **User Experience Issues**: Poor contrast and readability due to complex theming

#### Solution Required
- **Simplify Color System**: Use basic light/dark backgrounds with consistent patterns
- **Remove Complex Gradients**: Replace with simple, readable color schemes
- **Consolidate CSS Rules**: Reduce 200+ rules to essential theming only
- **Establish Design System**: Create consistent color tokens and theming approach

### 2. Theme System CSS Specificity Issues (2025-01-XX)
**LESSON LEARNED**: CSS specificity is critical for theme systems - use high-specificity selectors to override conflicting styles.

#### What Happened
- Implemented dark/light mode theme system with React Context API
- Theme toggle was working (console logs confirmed theme switching)
- Landing page background remained dark blue in light mode despite CSS rules
- Multiple attempts with different CSS approaches failed
- Issue persisted for hours of debugging

#### Root Cause
- **CSS Specificity Problem**: Original selectors like `.light body` were being overridden
- **Solution Required**: High-specificity selectors like `html.light body`
- **Key Discovery**: Used bright red background (`#ff0000`) for testing to confirm CSS was loading

#### Key Takeaway
- **CSS Specificity Matters**: Higher specificity selectors override lower ones
- **Test with Obvious Colors**: Use bright, obvious colors for debugging
- **Target Multiple Elements**: Don't assume one element controls the background
- **Verify Theme Application**: Check that theme classes are actually applied

#### Final Solution
```css
/* High-specificity selectors that work */
html.light,
html.light body,
html.light #__next,
html.light .min-h-screen {
  background-color: #f8fafc !important;
  background: #f8fafc !important;
}
```

### 3. Landing Page Text Color Override Issue (2025-01-XX)
**LESSON LEARNED**: When CSS overrides fail, inspect the actual element to identify the correct classes to target.

#### What Happened
- "🎯 Phase 1: Scientific Framework Development" text was dark blue on dark background in dark mode
- Multiple attempts to override with custom classes (`phase-1-text`) failed
- CSS rules were not being applied despite high specificity
- Issue persisted through multiple debugging attempts

#### Root Cause
- **Wrong Target Classes**: CSS was targeting custom classes that didn't exist in the element
- **Actual Element Classes**: The span only had `text-blue-900 text-sm font-semibold` classes
- **Missing Element Inspection**: AI was not inspecting the actual rendered element

#### Debugging Process
1. **User Used F12 Developer Tools**: 
   - Went to Elements tab
   - Found the specific container
   - Copied the element HTML
   - Provided actual element structure: `<div class="inline-flex items-center px-6 py-3 bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full border border-white/30 shadow-lg"><span class="text-blue-900 text-sm font-semibold">🎯 Phase 1: Scientific Framework Development</span></div>`

2. **Key Discovery**: 
   - Element had no custom `phase-1-text` class
   - Only had Tailwind classes: `text-blue-900 text-sm font-semibold`
   - Background was `bg-white/90` (light gray), not dark

3. **Solution Applied**:
   - Targeted actual classes present in element
   - Used high-specificity selectors
   - Tested with bright red color first to confirm CSS was loading
   - Applied final white color for visibility

#### Final Solution
```css
/* Target the actual classes present in the element */
html.dark .inline-flex.items-center.px-6.py-3.bg-white\/90 span.text-blue-900,
html.light .inline-flex.items-center.px-6.py-3.bg-white\/90 span.text-blue-900,
.inline-flex.items-center.px-6.py-3.bg-white\/90 span.text-blue-900 {
  color: #ffffff !important;
  background: transparent !important;
}
```

#### Key Takeaways
- **Always Inspect Actual Element**: Use F12 Developer Tools to see real element structure
- **Target Existing Classes**: Don't assume custom classes exist - target what's actually there
- **Test with Obvious Colors**: Use bright colors (like red) to confirm CSS is loading
- **High Specificity Required**: Use full class chains for maximum specificity
- **User Collaboration**: When AI debugging fails, user inspection is invaluable

#### Future Prevention
- **AI Should Request Element Inspection**: When CSS overrides fail, ask user to inspect element
- **Use F12 Developer Tools**: Copy actual element HTML for accurate targeting
- **Test with Bright Colors**: Always test CSS changes with obvious colors first
- **Document Element Structure**: Keep track of actual rendered element classes

### 3. Discussions Page Failure Due to Over-Optimization (2025-09-05)
**LESSON LEARNED**: Never optimize working systems without explicit user request and clear justification.

#### What Happened
- Added throttling to `refreshGlobalAdminStatus()` to reduce "excessive" calls
- This broke the discussions page by preventing legitimate database queries
- User correctly identified that page was working before our changes
- Required extensive debugging to identify root cause

#### Key Takeaway
- **"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"** - Working systems should not be modified without clear need
- **Trust user feedback** - User knew exactly when the problem started
- **Measure first** - Should have verified if performance issues actually existed
- **Test in isolation** - Changes should be tested separately before applying broadly

#### Prevention
- Always ask "why?" before making optimizations
- Test changes in separate branches first
- Have rollback plans ready
- Document dependencies between systems

## 🔐 Critical Authentication Knowledge

### Supabase Authentication System
**THIS IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND** - The user has repeatedly encountered authentication issues due to misunderstanding how Supabase works with custom role tables.

#### How It Actually Works
1. **`auth.users` table** (Supabase managed):
   - Contains: `id` (UUID), `email`, `created_at`, etc.
   - **DOES NOT contain application roles**
   - Managed entirely by Supabase

2. **`user_roles` table** (Custom application table):
   - Contains: `user_id` (UUID reference), `role`, `created_at`
   - **DOES NOT store email addresses**
   - Only stores UUID references to `auth.users(id)`

#### User's Current Setup
- **Email**: `jasen.nelson@gmail.com`
- **UUID**: `c632b5bc-6666-4b5f-8ef3-ca851dcee762`
- **Admin Role**: ✅ Exists in `user_roles` table
- **Email in user_roles**: ❌ Not stored (and shouldn't be)

#### Why This Confusion Keeps Happening
- User expects email to be in `user_roles` table
- User has admin role but loses it on browser refresh
- UUID-based authentication is not intuitive
- Previous troubleshooting attempts focused on wrong solutions

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login → Supabase Auth → Session with UUID → Query user_roles → Determine Permissions
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ **Don't query user_roles by email** - it doesn't store emails
❌ **Don't assume user_roles contains user details** - it only contains role mappings
✅ **Always query by UUID** - use `auth.uid()` or session user ID
✅ **Join with auth.users** - if you need email + role information

## 🚨 Authentication Troubleshooting

### When Admin Authentication Fails
1. **Verify UUID exists in auth.users**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'jasen.nelson@gmail.com';
   ```

2. **Verify admin role exists in user_roles**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = 'c632b5bc-6666-4b5f-8ef3-ca851dcee762';
   ```

3. **Check RLS policies** are properly configured
4. **Verify Supabase connection** and environment variables

### Quick Fix for Admin Issues
```sql
-- Add admin role for user (replace with actual UUID)
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
SELECT id, 'admin' 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'jasen.nelson@gmail.com'
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

## 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes & Issues Resolved

### Logout Functionality Fix (Latest - Critical)
**Issue**: Member users unable to logout due to loading state blocking UI
**Error**: Logout buttons not visible when `isLoading` state was true
**Root Cause**: Loading state was blocking entire header UI, preventing logout access
**Files Affected**: `src/components/Header.tsx`
**Solution**: 
- Modified loading state to only block UI when no session exists
- Added timeout protection to admin role checking (10 seconds)
- Simplified logout logic to always clear state and redirect
- Ensured logout buttons are always visible for authenticated users
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All users can now logout reliably

### Admin Role Checking Optimization (Latest)
**Issue**: Infinite recursion errors and 406 errors on user_roles queries
**Error**: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'user_roles'" and 406 Not Acceptable
**Root Cause**: RLS policies with circular dependencies and aggressive admin role checking
**Files Affected**: `src/components/Header.tsx`, RLS policies in database
**Solution**: 
- Simplified RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion
- Added timeout protection to role checking queries
- Improved error handling for member vs admin users
- Reduced console noise for non-admin users
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Clean role checking without errors

### Test DB Relocation (Latest)
**Issue**: Test DB link was showing in header navigation for admin users
**Root Cause**: Test DB was placed in header for debugging convenience
**Files Affected**: `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`
**Solution**: 
- Moved Test DB link from header navigation to admin dashboard
- Added Test DB card to admin dashboard management grid
- Test DB now properly located with other admin tools
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Test DB properly located in admin dashboard

### Next.js 15+ Server Actions Import Fix
**Issue**: Client components cannot import server actions that use `next/headers`
**Error**: `You're importing a component that needs "next/headers". That only works in a Server Component but one of its parents is marked with "use client"`
**Root Cause**: Server actions with `next/headers` cannot be imported into client components
**Files Affected**: Admin management components (Tags, Announcements, Milestones)
**Solution**: Created API routes (`/api/*`) as intermediaries between client components and server actions
**Pattern**: Client Component → API Route → Server Action → Database
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All admin components now work correctly

### Hydration Error Fix
**Issue**: React hydration mismatch between server and client rendering
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent text references to "SSTAC Dashboard" vs "SSTAC & TWG Dashboard"
**Files Fixed**: 
- `src/components/Header.tsx` ✅
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx` ✅
**Solution**: Standardized all references to "SSTAC & TWG Dashboard"

### Database View Missing (Critical)
**Issue**: Forum returns 404 error when accessing `discussion_stats` view
**Root Cause**: Database view `discussion_stats` not created in Supabase
**Error**: `GET /rest/v1/discussion_stats?select=*&order=created_at.desc 404 (Not Found)`
**Solution**: Run SQL to create missing view (see SQL commands below)

### Required SQL Fix
```sql
-- Create the discussion_stats view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW discussion_stats AS
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.title,
  d.user_email as author,
  d.created_at,
  d.updated_at,
  COUNT(r.id) as reply_count,
  MAX(r.created_at) as last_reply_at
FROM discussions d
LEFT JOIN discussion_replies r ON d.id = r.discussion_id
GROUP BY d.id, d.title, d.user_email, d.created_at, d.updated_at
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;

-- Grant permissions on the view
GRANT SELECT ON discussion_stats TO authenticated;
```

## 🚨 Critical Poll System Misunderstandings (January 2025)

### **Issue**: Multiple Incorrect Assumptions Despite Documentation Review
**Problem**: AI made multiple wrong assumptions about poll system despite:
- Reviewing existing markdown files
- Running multiple diagnostic queries
- Having access to system documentation

**Only Solution**: User provided CSV exports of actual database tables
**Root Cause**: 
- Assumed polls table contained all questions
- Assumed missing polls without checking ranking_polls table
- Misunderstood vote counting differences between poll types
- Assumed CEW polls didn't exist based on admin panel display issues

**Key Learnings**:
1. **Two separate systems**: Single-choice and ranking polls are completely independent
2. **CSV exports are truth**: Always verify with actual data exports
3. **Admin panel complexity**: Question matching logic is sophisticated
4. **Vote counting differs**: Single-choice sums votes, ranking counts participants
5. **Never assume missing data**: Check both tables before concluding polls are missing

**Prevention Protocol**:
- ✅ **Always verify system state** with CSV exports
- ✅ **Understand that polls and ranking_polls** are separate systems
- ✅ **Recognize that vote counting logic** differs between poll types
- ✅ **Don't assume admin panel issues** mean missing data
- ✅ **Check both tables** before concluding polls are missing

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **The dashboard is working well** - Focus on new features, not fixing working systems
2. **Admin badge persistence is robust** - Don't modify the established solution
3. **Phase 3 like system is complete** - Build on it, don't rewrite it
4. **Follow established patterns** - Use the same architecture for consistency
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure new features don't break existing functionality
6. **Document all changes** - Keep documentation current and accurate
7. **Maintain performance** - Keep the dashboard fast and responsive
8. **CSV exports are truth** - Always verify system state with actual data
9. **Two poll systems exist** - Single-choice and ranking polls are completely separate
