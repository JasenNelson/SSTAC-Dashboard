## üîê Critical Authentication Knowledge

### Supabase Authentication System
**THIS IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND** - The user has repeatedly encountered authentication issues due to misunderstanding how Supabase works with custom role tables.

#### How It Actually Works
1. **`auth.users` table** (Supabase managed):
   - Contains: `id` (UUID), `email`, `created_at`, etc.
   - **DOES NOT contain application roles**
   - Managed entirely by Supabase

2. **`user_roles` table** (Custom application table):
   - Contains: `user_id` (UUID reference), `role`, `created_at`
   - **DOES NOT store email addresses**
   - Only stores UUID references to `auth.users(id)`

#### User's Current Setup
- **Email**: `jasen.nelson@gmail.com`
- **UUID**: `c632b5bc-6666-4b5f-8ef3-ca851dcee762`
- **Admin Role**: ‚úÖ Exists in `user_roles` table
- **Email in user_roles**: ‚ùå Not stored (and shouldn't be)

#### Why This Confusion Keeps Happening
- User expects email to be in `user_roles` table
- User has admin role but loses it on browser refresh
- UUID-based authentication is not intuitive
- Previous troubleshooting attempts focused on wrong solutions

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login ‚Üí Supabase Auth ‚Üí Session with UUID ‚Üí Query user_roles ‚Üí Determine Permissions
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
‚ùå **Don't query user_roles by email** - it doesn't store emails
‚ùå **Don't assume user_roles contains user details** - it only contains role mappings
‚úÖ **Always query by UUID** - use `auth.uid()` or session user ID
‚úÖ **Join with auth.users** - if you need email + role information

## üö® Authentication Troubleshooting

### When Admin Authentication Fails
1. **Verify UUID exists in auth.users**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'jasen.nelson@gmail.com';
   ```

2. **Verify admin role exists in user_roles**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = 'c632b5bc-6666-4b5f-8ef3-ca851dcee762';
   ```

3. **Check RLS policies** are properly configured
4. **Verify Supabase connection** and environment variables

### Quick Fix for Admin Issues
```sql
-- Add admin role for user (replace with actual UUID)
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
SELECT id, 'admin' 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'jasen.nelson@gmail.com'
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

## üêõ Recent Bug Fixes & Issues Resolved

### Logout Functionality Fix (Latest - Critical)
**Issue**: Member users unable to logout due to loading state blocking UI
**Error**: Logout buttons not visible when `isLoading` state was true
**Root Cause**: Loading state was blocking entire header UI, preventing logout access
**Files Affected**: `src/components/Header.tsx`
**Solution**: 
- Modified loading state to only block UI when no session exists
- Added timeout protection to admin role checking (10 seconds)
- Simplified logout logic to always clear state and redirect
- Ensured logout buttons are always visible for authenticated users
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - All users can now logout reliably

### Admin Role Checking Optimization (Latest)
**Issue**: Infinite recursion errors and 406 errors on user_roles queries
**Error**: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'user_roles'" and 406 Not Acceptable
**Root Cause**: RLS policies with circular dependencies and aggressive admin role checking
**Files Affected**: `src/components/Header.tsx`, RLS policies in database
**Solution**: 
- Simplified RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion
- Added timeout protection to role checking queries
- Improved error handling for member vs admin users
- Reduced console noise for non-admin users
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Clean role checking without errors

### Test DB Relocation (Latest)
**Issue**: Test DB link was showing in header navigation for admin users
**Root Cause**: Test DB was placed in header for debugging convenience
**Files Affected**: `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`
**Solution**: 
- Moved Test DB link from header navigation to admin dashboard
- Added Test DB card to admin dashboard management grid
- Test DB now properly located with other admin tools
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Test DB properly located in admin dashboard

### Next.js 15+ Server Actions Import Fix
**Issue**: Client components cannot import server actions that use `next/headers`
**Error**: `You're importing a component that needs "next/headers". That only works in a Server Component but one of its parents is marked with "use client"`
**Root Cause**: Server actions with `next/headers` cannot be imported into client components
**Files Affected**: Admin management components (Tags, Announcements, Milestones)
**Solution**: Created API routes (`/api/*`) as intermediaries between client components and server actions
**Pattern**: Client Component ‚Üí API Route ‚Üí Server Action ‚Üí Database
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - All admin components now work correctly

### Hydration Error Fix
**Issue**: React hydration mismatch between server and client rendering
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent text references to "SSTAC Dashboard" vs "SSTAC & TWG Dashboard"
**Files Fixed**: 
- `src/components/Header.tsx` ‚úÖ
- `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx` ‚úÖ
**Solution**: Standardized all references to "SSTAC & TWG Dashboard"

### Database View Missing (Critical)
**Issue**: Forum returns 404 error when accessing `discussion_stats` view
**Root Cause**: Database view `discussion_stats` not created in Supabase
**Error**: `GET /rest/v1/discussion_stats?select=*&order=created_at.desc 404 (Not Found)`
**Solution**: Run SQL to create missing view (see SQL commands below)

### Required SQL Fix
```sql
-- Create the discussion_stats view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW discussion_stats AS
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.title,
  d.user_email as author,
  d.created_at,
  d.updated_at,
  COUNT(r.id) as reply_count,
  MAX(r.created_at) as last_reply_at
FROM discussions d
LEFT JOIN discussion_replies r ON d.id = r.discussion_id
GROUP BY d.id, d.title, d.user_email, d.created_at, d.updated_at
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;

-- Grant permissions on the view
GRANT SELECT ON discussion_stats TO authenticated;
```
