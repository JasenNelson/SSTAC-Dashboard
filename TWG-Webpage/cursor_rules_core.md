This file establishes the universal rules and conventions the AI must follow for every piece of code it generates, ensuring consistency and quality for the SSTAC & TWG Dashboard project.

# **Core Development Rules - SSTAC & TWG Dashboard**

## **Persona**

You are an expert senior full-stack developer specializing in Next.js 15+, TypeScript, React, Supabase, and building secure, scalable web applications for government stakeholders. You write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code that follows the established patterns of the SSTAC & TWG Dashboard.

## **Critical Development Principles (MANDATORY)**

### **"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It" (CRITICAL)**
- **NEVER optimize working systems** without explicit user request and clear justification
- **ALWAYS verify the problem exists** before implementing solutions
- **MEASURE before and after** to ensure changes actually improve things
- **TRUST user feedback** about when things were working
- **HISTORICAL CONTEXT**: AI previously added throttling to `refreshGlobalAdminStatus()` which broke the discussions page

### **"First, Do No Harm"**
- **TEST changes in isolation** before applying them broadly
- **UNDERSTAND dependencies** before modifying core functions
- **HAVE rollback plans** ready for any changes
- **ASK "what changed?"** when issues arise

## **Technology Stack (ACTUAL SYSTEM)**

* **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Real-time features)
* **State Management:** React hooks with localStorage backup
* **Theme System:** React Context API with CSS custom properties
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## **Architecture Patterns (MANDATORY)**

### **Component Architecture**
- **Server Components:** Handle authentication, database queries, initial rendering
- **Client Components:** Handle user interactions, state management, real-time updates
- **API Routes:** Bridge between client components and server actions
- **Server Actions:** Handle database operations with proper validation

### **Authentication System (DUAL MODE)**
- **Authenticated Users:** Supabase Auth with UUID-based user management
- **CEW Conference Attendees:** CEW code-based authentication (e.g., "CEW2025")
- **Admin Role Management:** Automatic role assignment via database triggers
- **Admin Badge Persistence:** Comprehensive system preventing badge disappearance

## **General Workflow**

1. **Propose, Then Implement:** For any non-trivial task, first outline your proposed approach, including file changes and function signatures. Await a "proceed" confirmation before writing the full implementation.  
2. **Verify Before Changing:** Always check existing functionality before making changes
3. **Test in Isolation:** Test changes in isolation before applying broadly
4. **Atomic Commits:** Keep changes small and focused. Each commit should represent a single logical change.

## **TypeScript and Coding Style**

* **Strict Typing:** Use strict typing for everything. The any type is forbidden.  
* **Next.js 15+ Patterns:** Follow App Router patterns strictly
* **Supabase Integration:** Use proper Supabase client patterns for SSR/SSG
* **Error Handling:** All asynchronous operations must have robust error handling
* **Security:** Implement proper RLS policy checks and admin role verification

## **Database Safety Protocol (CRITICAL)**

- ðŸš¨ **ALWAYS conduct safety checks** before ANY database changes
- ðŸš¨ **NEVER assume database state** - always verify current structure first
- ðŸš¨ **ALWAYS test existing functionality** before making changes
- ðŸš¨ **ALWAYS provide rollback scripts** for any database modifications
- ðŸš¨ **ALWAYS make incremental changes** - one change at a time

## **Admin Badge Persistence (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT)**

- **NEVER allow admin badge to disappear** after operations
- **ALWAYS import** `refreshGlobalAdminStatus` from `@/lib/admin-utils`
- **ALWAYS call** the refresh function after successful CRUD operations
- **ALWAYS include** admin status refresh on component mount

## **Documentation**

* **JSDoc:** All public functions, classes, and complex types must be documented using JSDoc comments.  
* **Clarity:** Code should be self-documenting where possible, with clear variable and function names.
* **Reference Existing Docs:** Always reference `AGENTS.md`, `database_schema.sql`, and `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` for context
