- [ ] **No Test Data**: Confirm no test-related data remains

### **Expected Remaining Polls:**
- [ ] Holistic Protection: 2 polls (CEW + Survey, poll_index 0)
- [ ] Tiered Framework: 1 poll (Survey, poll_index 0) 
- [ ] Prioritization: 4 polls (Survey + CEW, poll_index 3 & 7)
- [ ] One ranking question in wrong table (to be fixed in Phase 2)

## üö® **Rollback Triggers**

**STOP and ROLLBACK if:**
- [ ] Any error occurs during execution
- [ ] Admin panel doesn't load after cleanup

- [ ] Poll results don't display correctly
- [ ] Any unexpected data loss occurs

## üìû **Rollback Procedure**

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS polls;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ranking_polls;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS poll_votes;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ranking_votes;

ALTER TABLE polls_backup_20250120 RENAME TO polls;
ALTER TABLE ranking_polls_backup_20250120 RENAME TO ranking_polls;
ALTER TABLE poll_votes_backup_20250120 RENAME TO poll_votes;
ALTER TABLE ranking_votes_backup_20250120 RENAME TO ranking_votes;

-- Verify rollback successful
SELECT COUNT(*) as polls_count FROM polls;
SELECT COUNT(*) as votes_count FROM poll_votes;
```
