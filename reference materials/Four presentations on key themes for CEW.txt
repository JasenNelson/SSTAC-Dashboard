## Proposed Core Framework

[cite_start]The proposed framework is designed to be modern, holistic, and inclusive of diverse needs. [cite: 34, 35]


### Matrix Sediment Standards Framework
[cite_start]This approach uses separate standards to protect both ecological and human health across two pathways: **direct contact** and the **food web**. [cite: 38]

### Tiered Approach
[cite_start]This includes a scientific framework that allows for site-specific adjustments of the matrix sediment standards. [cite: 40]

---

## Survey Overview & Key Messages

# Presentation 2: Defining Holistic Protection: A Matrix Sediment Standards Framework

[cite_start]**Presenters & Facilitators:** Beth Power & Jasen Nelson [cite: 426]  
[cite_start]**Affiliation:** Science Advisory Board for Contaminated Sites in BC, Sediment Science and Technical Advisory Committee [cite: 427, 428]

---

## Why "Holistic Protection" Matters

* [cite_start]**Current Standards:** Current standards are based on direct toxicity to amphipods and are only assumed to be protective of other organisms. [cite: 431]
* [cite_start]**Ecosystem Integrity:** True protection requires ensuring the health of all organisms, from bottom-dwellers to those in the water column. [cite: 433]
* [cite_start]**Food Pathway Toxicity:** Contaminants can move through food webs, impacting fish, wildlife, and people who consume aquatic organisms. [cite: 435]


### Key Messages from Survey on Bioaccumulation
* [cite_start]**73%** of respondents found the current standards to be "Not Effective" or "Slightly Effective" at preventing bioaccumulation. [cite: 438, 439]
* [cite_start]**76.7%** felt that addressing bioaccumulation is moderately to very necessary/essential in future standards. [cite: 445, 446]

> [cite_start]"The BC CSR sediment standards are not appropriate or adequate to protect upper trophic level organisms, apex predators and humans at the top of foodwebs..." [cite: 452]

> [cite_start]"True sediment COCs are not always identified as bioaccumulation is not considered at the investigation stage." [cite: 453]

---

## Matrix Sediment Standards (SedS) Framework

[cite_start]This framework is designed to provide holistic protection by addressing different exposure pathways for both ecological and human health. [cite: 217]


* **Direct Toxicity (SedS-direct)**
    * [cite_start]**SedS-directECO:** Protects aquatic organisms from direct exposure to contaminants in sediment. [cite: 238, 239]
    * [cite_start]**SedS-directHH:** Protects people from risks associated with direct contact (e.g., ingestion, dermal contact) during recreational or cultural activities. [cite: 240, 241]
* **Food Pathway Toxicity (SedS-food)**
    * [cite_start]**SedS-foodECO:** Protects piscivorous wildlife (like otters, eagles, and orcas) from the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants. [cite: 243, 244]
    * [cite_start]**SedS-foodHH:** Protects humans who consume fish, shellfish, and other aquatic foods. [cite: 245, 246]

### Integrating Advanced Science
Deriving values for the matrix requires advanced scientific tools:
* [cite_start]**Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs):** Statistical models used for SedS-directECO. [cite: 478, 479, 488]
* [cite_start]**Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors (BSAFs):** Ratios that quantify how contaminants move from sediment into organisms. [cite: 480, 482]
* [cite_start]**Food-Web Models (FWMs):** Simulations of contaminant transfer through entire ecosystems. [cite: 483]
* [cite_start]**Bioaccumulation Based Sediment Guideline Values (BBSGV):** Risk-based estimates protective of the food exposure pathway. [cite: 484, 485]

[cite_start]These tools (BBSGVs, BSAFs, FWMs) are essential for deriving the SedS-food standards. [cite: 488]

# Presentation 3: Expanding the Tiered Framework: Site-Specific Numerical Sediment Standards

[cite_start]**Presenters:** Wayne Landis, Jasen Nelson [cite: 523]  
[cite_start]**Facilitators:** Jennifer Trowell, Geoff Wickstrom, Marc Cameron, Shannon Bard [cite: 524]  
[cite_start]**Affiliation:** Science Advisory Board for Contaminated Sites in BC, Science and Standards Technical Advisory Committee [cite: 525, 526]

---

## Why a Tiered Framework?

[cite_start]A tiered framework allows for more adaptable and effective sediment management. [cite: 531]

* [cite_start]**Current Limitations:** Generic, fixed concentration standards don't account for environmental factors that affect toxicity, which can lead to assessments that are either too conservative or not protective enough. [cite: 529]
* [cite_start]**Adaptable Approach:** Site-specific standards (a Tier 2 option) reduce uncertainty and streamline assessments by using site conditions instead of conservative assumptions. [cite: 531]
* [cite_start]**Enhanced Protection:** This approach supports better decision-making, leading to improved environmental outcomes and more effective use of resources. [cite: 534]

### Key Messages from Survey
* [cite_start]**86.4%** of respondents found a tiered framework would be beneficial. [cite: 536, 537]
* [cite_start]**88.1%** felt that incorporating bioavailability adjustments is important or essential. [cite: 541, 542]

> [cite_start]"Exceeding a standard for a particular substance is almost irrelevant without the context of bioavailability..." [cite: 549]

> [cite_start]"The bioavailability in sediment helps us understand not just how much contaminant is present, but whether it is causing harm...This distinction is required to make informed decisions..." [cite: 550]

## Proposed Three-Tier Framework


* **Tier 1: Screening Level Numerical Assessment**
    * [cite_start]Uses conservative, generic standards for initial site screening to quickly identify sites needing more assessment. [cite: 227]
* **Tier 2a: Refined Numerical Assessment**
    * [cite_start]Uses models and procedures (e.g., Cause-Effect) to derive site-specific standards, primarily for bioavailability adjustments. [cite: 229, 230]
* **Tier 2b: Screening-Level Risk-Based Assessment**
    * [cite_start]Similar to Tier 2a but adds prescribed lines of evidence, such as community analysis. [cite: 232]
* **Tier 3: Detailed Risk-Based Assessment**
    * [cite_start]A full risk assessment using multiple lines of evidence and site-specific factors. [cite: 234, 235]

## Key Areas for Modernization

[cite_start]Modernizing the framework requires focusing on several key areas to ensure standards are protective, practical, and aligned with the best science. [cite: 209, 210]

* [cite_start]**Tiered, Site-Specific Approach:** Moving beyond fixed standards to adaptable, risk-based assessments that account for local conditions. [cite: 212]

# Presentation 5: Weaving Indigenous Knowledges into Sediment Standards

---

## Bridging from Vision to Action

[cite_start]Modern sediment standards must be holistic, place-based, and respectfully braid Indigenous wisdom with Western science. [cite: 359] [cite_start]This involves embracing concepts like **'Two-Eyed Seeing'** and recognizing that waters and lands are kin. [cite: 358]

[cite_start]A precedent-setting example is the **Tsleil-Waututh Nation's** work on the Burrard Inlet Water Quality Objectives, which demonstrates a successful government-to-government process that weaves knowledge to create numerical values protective of cultural practices, like the ability to safely harvest shellfish. [cite: 360, 361]

[cite_start]The goal is to apply these principles to the scientific framework for modernizing BC's sediment standards. [cite: 363]


---

## Opportunities for Braiding Knowledge & Science

[cite_start]There are potential opportunities for weaving Indigenous Knowledges & Science (IK&S) into the project. [cite: 366]

### Holistic Protection Approach
* [cite_start]**The IK&S Opportunity:** This involves re-visioning the conceptual exposure model to answer the question: What does it mean to protect Indigenous Uses? [cite: 369] [cite_start]This could mean defining "health" to include the well-being of culturally significant species and the ability for communities to maintain their relationship with the water. [cite: 370]

### Tiered, Site-Specific Approach
* [cite_start]**The IK&S Opportunity:** A collaborative study to gather area-based knowledge could be a good first step. [cite: 373] [cite_start]This could support a cause-effect approach to better understand real-world conditions, including cumulative effects, complex mixtures, and Indigenous Uses. [cite: 374]

---

## Key Questions & Polls

Discussion and polls focused on how to practically integrate IK&S into the scientific framework.

* **Poll 1: A Braided Baseline Study:** Asked for the most effective starting point for a study combining co-located sampling with area-based IK&S. [cite_start]Options included co-developing a conceptual site model first, conducting a comprehensive data review, or starting with a collaborative pilot study. [cite: 387, 388, 389, 390]
* **Poll 2: Enhancing Scientific Protection Goals:** Explored how to incorporate Indigenous Stewardship principles like 'connectedness of all life.' [cite_start]Scientific approaches included using food-web models, developing Species Sensitivity Distributions with culturally significant species, and setting protective tissue residue guidelines. [cite: 398, 399, 400, 401]
* **Poll 3: A Braided Tiered Approach in Practice:** Asked where place-based Indigenous Knowledge could provide the most direct scientific value in modifying a generic value to be site-specific. [cite_start]Options included informing bioavailability models, identifying sensitive local species, and characterizing unique exposure pathways. [cite: 408, 409, 410, 411]
