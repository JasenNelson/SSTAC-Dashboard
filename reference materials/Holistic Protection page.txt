Why "Holistic Protection" for BC Sediments
- Direct Toxicity to Amphipods Only: Current standards based on amphipod toxicity, and assumed to be protective of other organisms.
- Ecosystem Integrity: Holistic protection requires ensuring the ecological health of bottom-dwelling and pelagic organisms.
- Food Pathway Toxicity: Contaminants in sediment move through food webs, affecting fish, birds, wildlife and people.

Key Messages from Survey: Bioaccumulation Prevention 
- 73% Current Sediment Standards are Not or Slightly Effective 
- 76.7% Necessary in Future Matrix Sediment Standards

"The BC CSR sediment standards are not appropriate or adequate to protect upper trophic level organisms, apex predators and humans at the top of foodwebs, as these sediment standards were or are designed for the protection of low tropic level species and benthic organisms."

Matrix Sediment Standards (SedS) Framework

Direct Toxicity (SedS-direct)
- SedS-directECO: Protect aquatic organisms from direct exposure from contaminants in sediment.
- SedS-directHH: Protects people from direct contact risks (e.g.,incidental ingestion, dermal contact) during recreational or cultural activities.

Food Pathway Toxicity (SedS-food)
- SedS-foodECO: Protects piscivorous wildlife (e.g., otters, eagles, orcas) from the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants through the food chain.
- SedS-foodHH: Protects human consumers of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic foods.


Polling: Looking for input on matrix sediment standards and how to prioritize them.

Feasible:
- Supporting technical information is available
- Capacity in BC - expertise, technology
- Likely affordable

Important:
- Will improve regulatory decisions related to contaminated sediments
- Addresses a critical gap in current regime
- Environmental protection
