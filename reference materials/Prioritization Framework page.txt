Why Modernize BC's Sediment Standards?

-Evolving Scientific Understanding: Scientific knowledge of sediment contamination and its ecological impacts continues to advance rapidly, creating opportunities for improvement.
- Non-scheduled & Emerging Contaminants: New chemicals and complex mixtures pose challenges not addressed by current standards.
- Site-Specific & Risk-Based Approaches: Modern frameworks offer more flexible, site-specific assessment methods that can be integrated into our standards.
- Ecosystem Protection: We must ensure our standards remain protective, practical, and aligned with the best available science.

Key Areas for Modernizing the Sediment Standards Framework

- Matrix Sediment Standards: Holistic protection of ecological organisms and people, from direct and food-related toxicity.
- Tiered, Site-Specific Sediment Standards: Moving beyond fixed standards to adaptable, risk-based assessments that account for local conditions.
- Emerging Contaminants / Mixtures: Addressing non-scheduled substances of concern and their combined effects on ecosystems.
- Harnessing Available Knowledge: Address prioritized data gaps such as: determining regional background levels, using results from recent field studies and research, and incorporating area-based Indigenous Knowledge & Science.

Matrix Sediment Standards (SedS) Framework

Direct Toxicity (SedS-direct)
- SedS-directECO: Protect aquatic organisms from direct exposure from contaminants in sediment.
- SedS-directHH: Protects people from direct contact risks (e.g.,incidental ingestion, dermal contact) during recreational or cultural activities.

Food Pathway Toxicity (SedS-food)
- SedS-foodECO: Protects piscivorous wildlife (e.g., otters, eagles, orcas) from the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants through the food chain.
- SedS-foodHH: Protects human consumers of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic foods.

Expanding the Tiered Framework

Tier 3: Risk-Based Standards: Protective for site conditions in accordance with Protocol 1
Tier 2: Site-Specific Sediment Standards: Bioavailability-adjusted and protective for site conditions
Tier 1: Matrix Sediment Standards: 'Safe' for any location due to conservative assumptions

Emerging Contaminants & Mixtures

The chemical landscape is constantly changing, requiring proactive approaches to address potential health hazards.
- Non-scheduled Substances: Standards for priority contaminants
- Complex Mixtures: Combined effects often not predicted by simple tests
- Adaptive Frameworks: Flexible tools & incorporate new science in standards framework
- Proactive Hazard Identification: Develop the scientific and regulatory tools to proactively address new hazards as they are identified.

Data Gap, Feasibility & Prioritization Framework
- Address Information Gaps: Collaborative research to address priorities such as missing substance groups, incorporating validated models, addressing all relevant pathways, and acknowledging Indigenous Knowledge & Science.
- Acknowledge Feasibility: Make use of existing resources where appropriate. Recognize limitations to time and expense of creating and approving new procedures .
- Prioritization: Develop a systemic approach for introducing the most important changes and easiest improvements first
- Goal: A framework for identifying and resolving data gaps, with short- and long-term goals for strategic research planning.
