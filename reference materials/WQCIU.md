\#\# Executive Summary  
Surface water and sediment quality criteria were defined to protect Indigenous water use by Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN), Fort McKay First Nation (FMFN) and Mikisew Cree First Nation (MCFN) members in the Lower Athabasca Region (LAR) using two approaches: current condition and risk-based. Current condition values were developed by collating and analyzing surface water and sediment quality monitoring data from multi-stakeholder, government and community-based programs and identifying representative values for three seasons (high flow, open water and under ice). Health risk criteria were defined by identifying valued components that reflect use of surface water by Indigenous community members; consumption of traditional foods, medicine and surface water, trapping furbearing mammals that consume aquatic biota, the health of wildlife (birds and mammals) from ingesting surface water and diet items, and aquatic ecosystem health. Available surface water and sediment quality guidelines were reviewed to identify level of protection for the traditional valued components. It was found that humans were more sensitive than aquatic biota and wildlife species for 50% of substances with published surface water quality guidelines. When unavailable, health risk criteria were derived using methods prescribed by regulatory agencies, using community specific ingestion rates of traditional foods (fish, and medicinal plants) estimated from a traditional food survey of 230 community members.

The study found goals reflecting current condition of surface water in the LAR indicated that, with a number of exceptions, water and sediment quality is relatively good. Current conditions were generally lower than the calculated risk-based criteria, with some exceptions especially for metals and metalloids. For risk-based protection goals, surface water quality guidelines for the protection of human health were available but not from governments in Alberta or Canada. Adopting human health water quality criteria from the United States Environmental Protection Agency provided a good starting point for protection for of community members consuming fish and drinking water from surface water bodies. However, the traditional food consumption rates were higher than those used to derive US EPA criteria and therefore the adoption of this approach in the WQCIUs required modification to account for the higher consumption rates of ACFN, FMFN, and MCFN members. The collection of statistically representative community survey results enabled the risk assessor to analyze and calculate community members’ ingestion rates of traditional foods and medicines for the three participating Indigenous communities.

The WQCIUs (for surface water and sediment) can be used by Indigenous communities, government and regulatory agencies and industry stakeholders to assess potential changes in surface water and sediment conditions and risks to human and ecological receptors from releases of contaminants from oil sands to the Athabasca River and downstream within Lake Athabasca and the Athabasca Delta. The WQCIUs were developed for constituents characterized in oil sands mine water (OSMW), as well as for several additional common constituents and measures. As a result, the health risk criteria can be used to assess risks from the placement of tailings and OSMW in aquatic closure (reclamation) features such as constructed wetlands and End Pit Lakes (EPLs).

This report is structured as follows: Chapter 1 includes a summary of the study findings, and applies health risk criteria to the calculated current conditions in the Lower Athabasca River, the Athabasca River Delta and Lake Athabasca; Chapter 2 details the development of the current conditions, Chapters 3 and 4 detail the development of the health risk criteria; and Chapter 5 provides some detail about the community consumption surveys conducted with and by ACFN, MCFN and FMFN.

\#\# Summary and Application of Findings

This document outlines an approach for the development of health risk criteria and establishment of current conditions against which chemical parameters in surface water and sediment can be assessed to identify potential health risks as well as changes in conditions over time and space. These Water and Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Indigenous Use (WQCIUs) were developed for the protection of water use by Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN), Fort McKay First Nation (FMFN) and Mikisew Cree First Nation (MCFN) in the Lower Athabasca River region (LAR) of Alberta. This chapter describes key results from this study and provides a comparison of the current condition of the Athabasca River, Athabasca River Delta and Lake Athabasca to the health risk criteria.

The WQCIUs were developed to address gaps in existing government water, sediment and tissue guidelines and water quality management frameworks. ACFN, FMFN and MCFN expectations for establishment of current conditions were that they would be season or flow-specific, and that they would be established for the entire Lower Athabasca Region (river, delta, lake). ACFN, FMFN and MCFN expectations for establishment of health risk criteria were that they would include all constituents of concern in the region, that they would account for bioaccumulation and biomagnification effects, that they would include humans, wildlife and plants as receptors, and that they would account for Indigenous community water uses.

The WQCIUs were developed to specifically consider the rights of Indigenous Peoples¹ and to support the evaluation of environmental conditions relative to tiers, triggers, limits, thresholds or other “limits of change” that ensure ecosystem components are sustainable, ecosystems are healthy, and effects to human health and well-being are avoided, minimized, or reduced as defined under the Oil Sands Monitoring Program (OSM)² Program.

More broadly, the health risk criteria and current conditions provide government and industry stakeholders with a framework and criteria for assessing performance of treatment technologies, produced effluents, and remediation and reclamation activities that reflect the values and interests of participating Indigenous communities. This includes risk tolerances and protection requirements for establishing and maintaining safe and usable environments to support exercising Aboriginal Rights, as defined by ACFN, FMFN and MCFN.

The WQCIUs reflect performance criteria which can be used to assess the health and safety of aquatic ecosystems to support Indigenous water uses. To be clear, any effort to adopt them as guidelines or objectives under provincial policy or legislative requirements ³ should only be undertaken with extensive consultation and engagement with the communities themselves.

³ Guidelines are science-based recommendations that form a cornerstone of water quality and aquatic ecosystem management. They are not legal instruments, however, guidelines and the site-specific objectives derived from them can be used in developing legally binding effluent limits under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA). They can also be used in management frameworks as part of Regional Plans developed under the Land-use Framework (GoA, 2008\) and the Alberta Land Stewardship Act, as well as other management tools. They are an integral component of the GOA Integrated Resource Management system that operates in accordance with the principle of cumulative effects management. The guidelines in this document support the Water Quality Based Effluent Limits Procedures Manual (AEP, 1995), the Alberta Tier 1 Soil and Groundwater Remediation Guidelines (Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP, 2016a), and the Alberta Tier 2 Soil and Groundwater Remediation Guidelines (AEP, 2016b). The recreation and aesthetic guidelines also support those in use by Alberta Health under the Public Health Act.

\#\# 1.1 Ecosystem Approach to Water Management  
Health risk criteria and current conditions were developed for protection of ecosystem function which includes ecological and human receptors and their interactions with abiotic components of the environment (Keen et al., 2012\) as described in Figure 1.1.

Environmental management decisions which consider the complex interactions within ecosystems more closely resemble the world views of Indigenous communities and traditional strategies for assessing and managing natural resources and minimizing health risks (Liboiron, 2021).

\*\*Figure 1.1:\*\* Ecosystem health approach to developing health risk criteria and current conditions for the protection of Indigenous water use and interactions with surface water and sediment.

\#\# 1.2 Water Use by Indigenous Communities  
Four water use categories, as presented in Table 1.1 were defined based on descriptions of water use described by community members from ACFN, FMFN and MCFN. The four categories were used to develop a conceptual model linking community members to the environment through exposure pathways, as well as identifying protection goals for surface water and sediment (see Section 3.4.1 of this report for more details of this process). In the development of Indigenous water use categories, water use by gender or age were not considered and further study may be necessary to understand exposure pathways by gender or age across the community. However, gender and age were considered in understanding community consumption patterns, barriers to consuming traditional foods and medicines and in the development of health risk criteria which considered consumption of traditional foods. Water is a core component of all aspects of life for ACFN, FMFN, and MCFN members. Each of the water use categories identified below should be understood as inextricably linked to ACFN, FMFN, and MCFN’s cultural and spiritual value of water.

\*\*Table 1.1:\*\* Indigenous community water uses and health protection goals used to define water use criteria.

| Indigenous water use | Protection Goal |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| Traditional foods and drinking water | Safe foods consumption\<br\>Safe natural surface water consumption |  
| Traditional medicines | Safe medicine consumption |  
| Aquatic ecosystem health | Aquatic community consumption unchanged\<br\>Robust populations\<br\>Natural behaviours and patterns |  
| Wildlife health | Healthy wildlife\<br\>Robust populations\<br\>Natural behaviours and patterns\<br\>Good quality pelts |

Exposure pathways, indicators and endpoints linked to water protection goals were then used to evaluate the level of protection offered by applying provincial and federal surface water quality guidelines. The results indicate that exposure pathways (ingestion of traditional foods, medicine, and surface water) and endpoints (e.g., carcinogenicity) for the protection of human health are not considered under environmental quality guidelines for the protection of surface water in Alberta or Canada (GoA, 2018; CCME, 2021). Protection goals linked to wildlife species are either less sensitive or not considered as frequently as aquatic biota, which was identified as the key protection endpoint. No reference to the protection of surface water for the spiritual and cultural needs of Indigenous communities were identified, as this was beyond the scope of this study. However, these are important components for inclusion in future work aimed at protecting all community water uses holistically.

Sediment is an integral component of aquatic ecosystems providing a substrate for fish and invertebrates to reproduce and live in and plants to grow but also a source of nutrients and energy supporting ecosystem production that supports the energy needs of food webs. Sediments act as sources and sinks for environmental contaminants, which can directly affect the health and diversity of benthos (plants and animals living at the bottom of a water body) interacting with the sediment and contribute to the biomagnification of persistent contaminants in aquatic and terrestrial food webs.

A review of sediment quality guidelines adopted in Alberta indicates a low level of protection both for benthic organisms and overlaying surface water due to limitations in available sediment toxicity test data and derivation methods.

\#\# 1.3 Water and Sediment Quality Criteria for Indigenous Use Protection

Review of provincial water quality management tools under policy and regulations revealed that the following are not currently considered by Alberta when assessing the condition of surface water to support management decisions.

\*   Surface water is not assessed as a drinking water source (GoA, 2018\)  
\*   Assessing the partitioning of contaminants to sediments and subsequent deposition and downstream transport is not required (AEP, 1995\)  
\*   Persistence and biomagnification of contaminants within aquatic and semi-aquatic food webs is not assessed (AEP, 1995; GoA, 2018\)  
\*   Risk to human health from ingestion of surface water and aquatic biota do not need to be assessed beyond application of Alberta surface water guidelines for aquatic life and recreation use (GoA, 2018\)  
\*   Current guidance on releases allow for impacts to acute and chronic mixing zone areas within natural receiving water (AEP, 1995\)  
\*   Water, sediment and tissue quality guidelines have not been published for each contaminant identified as having intrinsically toxic properties and characterized in oil sands mine water (i.e. naphthenic acids, low and high molecular weight PAHs).

The identified limitations in the provincial system for assessing and managing environmental and human risks from contaminants in surface water and sediment were addressed by developing health risk criteria for those media which allows for an assessment of potential impacts to Indigenous water use pathways; traditional foods and drinking water, traditional medicines, aquatic ecosystem health, and wildlife health.

Figure 1.2 (below) summarizes findings from a review of federal, provincial and international water quality guidelines for the protection of freshwater life/ aquatic biota (US EPA, AEP, CCME), wildlife (AEP, CCME, Sample et al. (1996)) and humans (US EPA, Health Canada, WHO). The pie chart indicates the percentage of published water quality guidelines that were developed to protect the most sensitive receptor group from the contaminants of interest evaluated in this study. The results indicate that humans are the most sensitive receptor group from exposure to 50% of the contaminants for which published water quality guidelines are available. Aquatic biota are the next most sensitive receptor group (44%) and finally wildlife species are generally less sensitive than human and aquatic receptors (3% of available guidelines noted wildlife species as the most sensitive receptors). The three receptor groups were equally as sensitive for the remaining guidelines. It is important to note that there was a lack of wildlife watering guidelines available for several parameters and additional health risk criteria were not derived, only available guidelines for livestock were adopted.

This is an important finding which supports the inclusion of guidelines derived for the protection of human health (Health Canada, US EPA, WHO), specifically for carcinogenic substances, which are not an assessment endpoint considered in protection of aquatic life or wildlife/ livestock water quality guidelines (AEP, CCME).

\*\*Figure 1.2:\*\* Comparison of the sensitivity between humans, aquatic biota, and wildlife species indicated by the percent of published surface water quality guidelines established to protect each receptor group (n \= 317\)  
\*   \*\*Group\*\*  
    \*   Aquatic Biota (44%)  
    \*   Human (50%)  
    \*   Similar Sensitivity (3%)  
    \*   Wildlife (3%)

Modifications of the published guidelines were also used to achieve a higher degree of protection for consumers of traditional foods from the communities of ACFN, FMFN, and MCFN, as previously reported consumption rates representing the general population (22 g/d; (US EPA, 2015a) and Northern Alberta Indigenous communities (27.8 g/d; (Chan et al., 2016)) were lower than those reported through the community surveys for fish (388 g/d), and rat root (6.8 g/d).

A generic health risk criteria for surface water quality that identifies the most sensitive water use by contaminant is proposed as a conservative approach similar to that adopted for assessing soil and groundwater contamination (GoA, 2018). The generic health risk criteria should be applied unless a specific water use category is being assessed to answer community or research study questions and each water use category is not being assessed individually. A single health risk criteria for sediment quality (mg/kg) is proposed for the protection of sediment associated biota and biomagnification within aquatic food webs.

Importantly, the health risk criteria proposed here address gaps in published surface water and sediment quality guidelines that could underestimate potential effects in the ambient environment from mixtures of PAHs from varying modes of action. The WQCIUs were developed to assess surface water and sediment quality monitoring data by various groupings. The first, carcinogenicity (as BaP equivalents) is used to assess potential risks to human receptors from exposure to carcinogenic PAH congeners in the traditional foods and drinking water and medicines water use categories. The second are non-carcinogenic effect-based groups for high and low molecular PAH congeners and are used assess risks to ecological receptors in the aquatic ecosystem and wildlife health water use categories.

Together, the Indigenous criteria for water (generic) and sediment presented in Table 1.2 and Table 1.3, will allow ACFN, FMFN and MCFN to assess the ability for surface water bodies to meet their needs by ensuring water, animals, and plants are safe to consume and that populations are healthy and available to support Indigenous use.
