Why Expand the Tiered Framework with Site-Specific Sediment Standards?

Current Limitations of Generic Sediment Standards:
- High uncertainty
- Conservative or underprotective

Proposed Site-Specific Sediment Standards
- Reduced uncertainty
- Streamlined remediation

Enhanced Protection
- Improved decision-making and environmental outcomes
- Effective resource allocation

Key Messages from Survey
86.4% Tiered Framework Beneficial for Future Sediment Standards Framework
88.1% Importance of Bioavailability Adjustments for Future Sediment Standards Framework

Three-Tier Framework
- Tier 3: Risk-Based Standards: Site-specific risk assessment
- Tier 2: Site-Specific Sediment Standards: Bioavailability-adjusted using Equilibrium Partitioning (EqP) and/or Biotic Ligand Model (BLM)
- Tier 1: Matrix Sediment Standards: Assumes generic site conditions
