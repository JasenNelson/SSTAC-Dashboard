Appendix G. CEW Session: What We Heard

1.0 Executive Summary

This report summarizes the feedback gathered from the half-day technical session (Holistic Protection of Aquatic Ecosystems: Modernizing Sediment Quality Assessment) held at the Canadian Ecotoxicity Workshop (CEW) on October 7, 2025. This session was designed as a targeted follow-up to the broader public survey (May-July 2025) to gather specific, technical feedback from experts, researchers, and practitioners.

Feedback was collected through real-time polling and a facilitated panel discussion. The key findings are:

Strong Technical Mandate: Experts overwhelmingly support the modernization of standards. All five key topics presented in the prioritization (Importance vs. Feasibility) polls were categorized by the group consensus as "High Priority Near-Term".

Clear Prioritization: When asked to rank actions to improve matrix standards, the clear top priority was to "Distinguish 'direct toxicity' and 'food pathway toxicity' pathways explicitly" (1.6 avg. rank).

Focus on Site-Specific Tools: The top-ranked focus for providing the greatest value to holistic sediment management was to "Push guidance beyond generic numerical standards" by applying models and tools to develop Site-Specific Sediment Standards (2.0 avg. rank).

Nuanced Views on Feasibility: While there was broad agreement on the importance of all proposed topics, the polling revealed significant expert debate on feasibility. Incorporating bioavailability adjustments, in particular, showed a clear split in opinion on whether it is "feasible now" or a "longer-term" goal.

2.0 Introduction and Methodology

The session's objective was to present the proposed scientific framework and gather insights from the technical community to inform its collaborative development. The session was structured around four key themes identified in the project's interim framework:

Holistic Protection: Matrix sediment standards.

Tiered Framework: Site-specific sediment standards.

Prioritization Framework: Prioritizing approaches and options for modernization.

Weaving Indigenous Knowledges: Weaving Indigenous wisdom and science into the framework.

Feedback was gathered using a two-part polling strategy to ensure broad and inclusive participation from the professional community:

Live Polling (CEW): During the session at CEW, polls were opened to all event attendees, capturing live feedback from a diverse group of practicing scientists, regulators, and experts. The screenshots in Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this appendix show these live results as they were captured during the event.

Authenticated Polling (SSTAC/TWG): To include professionals who could not attend CEW in person but wished to participate, a separate, authenticated poll was made available to SSTAC and TWG members. This poll opened just prior to the CEW event and remained open until November 8, 2025.

This report summarizes the quantitative findings from the live polling screenshots (Method 1). The qualitative findings from the panel discussion (Method 2) are summarized in Section 6.0.

3.0 Building on the Public Survey

This targeted technical engagement was designed to build directly upon the findings of the public survey (May-July 2025). The public survey (summarized in the Draft Sediment Standards Review: What We Heard report) confirmed a strong mandate for change, with 88% of respondents supporting modernization and 73% finding the current standards "Not Effective" or "Slightly Effective" at preventing bioaccumulation. The survey also identified a clear roadmap, with strong support for:

Expanding the contaminant list (95% "Essential" or "Very Important")

Incorporating bioavailability (91% "Essential" or "Very Important")

A formal tiered framework (86% "Beneficial" or "Very Beneficial")

A "Dual Standard" approach to address bioaccumulation (83% "Necessary" or "Beneficial")

The CEW polls were informed by this feedback and intended to provide a necessary level of technical refinement. Where the public survey asked if we should modernize, the CEW session asked how—focusing on specific methodologies, priorities, and the scientific feasibility of the proposed framework.

4.0 Key Findings: Expert Poll Responses

Participants were polled on three key themes: Holistic Protection, the Tiered Framework, and the Prioritization Framework.

4.1 Holistic Protection (Questions 1-8)

5.0 Key Findings: Prioritization Matrix (Importance vs. Feasibility)

Participants' paired responses for importance and feasibility were plotted on 2x2 matrix graphs.

Consensus Finding: All five topics were categorized by the expert consensus as "High Priority Near-Term" ("Very important and feasible now").
However, the distribution of individual responses (N=55 to 57) within the quadrants provides critical nuance about the degree of consensus.

Strong Consensus:

Matrix Standards (Ecosystem Health - Food-Related): Showed the tightest clustering, with the vast majority of experts agreeing on both high importance and high feasibility.
Figure G-19: (Chart showing consensus in top-right "HIGH PRIORITY NEAR-TERM" quadrant)

Matrix Standards (Ecosystem Health - Direct Toxicity): Also showed very strong consensus in the dominant quadrant.
Figure G-20: (Chart showing consensus in top-right "HIGH PRIORITY NEAR-TERM" quadrant)

General Consensus (with Feasibility Concerns):

Matrix Standards (Human Health - Direct Toxicity):
Figure G-21: (Chart showing consensus in top-right, with some responses in top-left "LONGER-TERM" quadrant)

Matrix Standards (Human Health - Food-Related):
Figure G-22: (Chart showing consensus in top-right, with a notable cluster in top-left "LONGER-TERM" quadrant)

For both human-health-related topics, a strong majority landed in the "High Priority Near-Term" quadrant. However, a notable number of responses also appeared in the "High Priority Longer-Term" (Top-Left) quadrant, suggesting disagreement on current feasibility.

Split Opinion on Feasibility:

Site-Specific Standards (Bioavailability): This topic showed the most division. While importance was universally high, responses were split almost evenly between the "High Priority Near-Term" (Top-Right) and "High Priority Longer-Term" (Top-Left) quadrants. This indicates significant expert debate on the current feasibility of implementing bioavailability adjustments.

6.0 Panel Discussion: Weaving Indigenous Knowledges

This session explored the "how" and "why" of braiding Indigenous wisdom with Western science. The session was framed by two key presentations:

A foundational vision (the 'why') from Dr. Shannon Waters (Indigenous person and Deputy Provincial Health Officer (PHO) in BC for water and planetary health), who spoke to the importance of "Two-Eyed Seeing" and recognizing waters and lands as kin.

A tangible example (the 'how') from Anuradha Rao and Melany Sanchez Solano (Tsleil-Waututh Nation), who detailed the Nation-led, government-to-government process of developing the Burrard Inlet Water Quality Objectives to protect cultural practices.

Following the presentations, the three speakers participated in a panel discussion. Key questions and themes from the discussion are summarized below.

On the Legal Status of Water Quality Objectives:

Audience Question: What are your concerns regarding the fact that the Burrard Inlet Water Quality Objectives are not legally binding?

Panel Response: Dr. Shannon Waters clarified that the Water Quality Objectives are binding in Tsleil-Waututh Nation (TWN) law, which describes how to live and protect the environment as part of daily life. Anu Rao added that TWN is actively developing policy on how to "mesh colonial and TWN law" for work in the Inlet.

On Reflecting Indigenous Values in Standards:

Moderator Question: What’s one key way sediment standards could better reflect Indigenous values, cultural uses, or community health needs?

Panel Response: The panel emphasized treating the environment as a food source for future generations. This requires a shift in thinking toward "net environmental gain" and a goal of "No new inputs of contamination into Mother Earth".

On Challenges of Braiding Knowledge:

Moderator Question: From your experience, what’s a key lesson—or challenge—you’ve faced when bringing Indigenous knowledge into Western scientific processes?

Panel Response: Dr. Waters noted a key challenge is moving beyond component-based protection (e.g., pipes, source water) to a "holistic watershed level" perspective, which is inherent in Indigenous Knowledge systems.

Final Thoughts: The panel's final thoughts centered on the foundational concept that in many First Nations languages, "Landscape = Kin". This perspective reframes environmental protection: "How we care about the environment should be how we care about our family".

7.0 Conclusion and Next Steps

The CEW technical session provided clear validation from the expert community for the proposed direction of the Sediment Standards Project. There is a strong consensus on what needs to be done: modernize standards to be holistic, protective of both human and ecological health, and inclusive of both direct and food-pathway toxicity.

The polling and matrix analyses provided a clear prioritization, with experts urging a focus on distinguishing toxicity pathways and advancing site-specific (Tier 2) tools. The primary barrier identified by this group is not a lack of agreement, but a need for resourcing to accomplish these goals.

The nuanced feedback and divided opinions on feasibility (especially for bioavailability and human health standards) are equally valuable. They highlight the key scientific and practical challenges that must be addressed in the next phase of the project. This feedback, combined with the public survey results, provides a robust foundation for developing the modernized framework.

Appendix J: TWG White Paper Review: What We Heard

1.0 Executive Summary

A review of the Modernizing BC Sediment Quality Standards v2.5 draft report (the "White Paper") was completed by a 29-member Technical Working Group (TWG) drawn from industry, consulting, government, academia, and Indigenous organizations. Overall, the TWG's feedback was highly positive. The report was rated "Excellent" or "Good" for Clarity, Completeness, and Defensibility by a strong majority of reviewers. The proposed framework is seen as robust, comprehensive, and a long-overdue modernization of the standards.

Key synthesis of feedback and recommendations includes:

Strengthen and Clarify Indigenous Integration: While the intent to integrate Indigenous Knowledge (IK) is praised, TWG feedback indicates the execution is not yet fully supported. The report must be updated to:

Include the policy rationale for IK integration (e.g., UNDRIP, BC's DRIPA).

Clarify complex policy implications (e.g., vs. Health Canada's DQRA process for traditional foods).

Correct the structural error of listing First Nations as "Canadian Jurisdictions."

Address Implementation Feasibility: There are significant concerns about real-world implementation. The report must more explicitly address limited laboratory capacity for chronic toxicity testing, eDNA, and the need for method standardization for passive samplers.

Improve Clarity and Readability: The report suffers from repetition (especially in the Introduction) and a "ChatGPT feel" (per one review). A professional edit is needed to tighten the language and improve flow.

Soften Declarative Language: The report's definitive language ("will be implemented") is inappropriate and must be softened to reflect its role as a recommendation to ENV.

Refine Scientific & Technical Details: Reviewers provided excellent technical suggestions, including:

Strengthening the Introduction with more apex predator food-web citations.

Clarifying the distinction between an Environmental Quality Guideline (EQG) and a Risk Assessment (RA) framework.

Refining key terminology ("direct protection" -> "direct contact"; "anti-degradation" -> "background screening").

This "What We Heard" report provides a detailed plan for revising the White Paper to address this valuable feedback.

2.0 Methodology

An online review form (the "TWG White Paper Review Form") was circulated to 29 TWG members, who provided detailed feedback during:

Phase 1 of the review (first five sections): October 8 to November 7, 2025; and

Phase 2 of the review (last two sections and appendices): November 13 to December 1, 2025.

The review form included a mix of quantitative rating questions (e.g., multiple choice) and qualitative, open-ended questions for both high-level and section-specific comments. This report summarizes all 29 submissions. Quantitative data is presented in graphs, and qualitative feedback has been synthesized into key themes and actionable recommendations.

4.0 Detailed Qualitative Feedback & Synthesis

The qualitative feedback was extensive and highly constructive. The following is a synthesis of key themes from all open-ended comments.

4.1 Overall Report Structure and Clarity

The Good: The report is "excellent and covers all the main points," "well thought out," and a "long-overdue" effort.

The Bad: Several reviewers noted significant repetition in the Introduction (Sections I.A, I.B, I.C). The language was also described as having a "ChatGPT feel" and would benefit from a "strong edit" to be more concise.

4.2 Integration of Indigenous Knowledge (IK)

This was a major theme across multiple reviews.

Gap in Rationale: Reviewers noted that the report states what it will do (integrate IK) but not why. It's missing the critical policy and legal rationale (e.g., BC's DRIPA, UNDRIP, and the creation of Dr. Shannon Waters' PHO position).

Overstated Claims: One reviewer felt the Executive Summary overstates the integration of IK, noting the rest of the document doesn't yet support this strong claim.

Policy & Jurisdictional Questions: A key policy question was raised about how the proposal to include Indigenous traditional food consumption in provincial standards will align or conflict with Health Canada's guidance, which typically requires a separate, detailed quantitative risk assessment (DQRA).

Structural Error: A critical error was identified: "First Nations are not 'Canadian Jurisdictions'" and must be moved out of Section III.B.

4.3 Implementation, Feasibility and Lab Capacity

This was the most prominent technical concern, led by feedback from laboratory experts.

Laboratory Capacity: The report is too optimistic about current lab capabilities. A reviewer explicitly stated that "Current laboratory capacity for chronic toxicity testing is limited, especially in BC."

Method Standardization: The report must more strongly emphasize the need for standardization. The same reviewer noted that "Passive sampling... [is] not a widely used analytical technique for regulatory purposes" and that "eDNA... results tended to vary widely" between labs. This poses a "lab shopping" risk.

4.4 Scientific Framework & Risk Assessment

EQG vs. RA: A key clarification is needed to define when the report is discussing Environmental Quality Guidelines (EQGs) (i.e., Tier 1 numbers) versus a Risk Assessment (RA) framework (i.e., Tiers 2/3).

Strengthen Rationale: The report's rationale for food-web transfer is good but can be much stronger. One reviewer provided a list of specific peer-reviewed papers (e.g., Alava et al., McTavish et al.) to add to Section I.B to better support the risks to apex predators in BC.

Acknowledge Uncertainty: A reviewer noted that the report should acknowledge the limitations of SSDs, which can lose the uncertainty data from the original NOEC/LOEC studies.
